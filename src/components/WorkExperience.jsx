                        Replaced a paper ticket system used to track part and tool rentals. Roughly 20 hours per week were being wasted managing this

                        I took the lead developer/project manager role. I designed the database schema and setup the servers required for the project
                        which included: database server running MariaDB, Apache server with PHP5, a GitLab server to host our code repository.

                        Using Angular 6 and Google Material Design, we implemented a clean and user friendly website to manage these parts and tools
                        in a more efficient manner.
